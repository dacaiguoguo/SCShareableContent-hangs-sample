# SCShareableContent hangs sample

Example project that sometimes(?) hangs when accessing SCSharableContent.current.

The await simply never returns.

This only happens occasionally. After developing a ScreenCaptureKit app for a while, and thus having started and killed many screen capture sessions.

Rebooting the computer "fixes" the problem.
